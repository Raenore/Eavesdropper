## Multi-Message Support
Eavesdropper intelligently handles long-form RP by detecting split messages from various addons, ensuring your history window stays cohesive even when an emote spans multiple posts.

While Eavesdropper is designed to be broadly compatible, the following addons are **explicitly supported**:
- Chattery
- EmoteSplitter
- Yapper

## Advanced RP Name Formatting
Eavesdropper can replace standard character names in system emotes (like `/point` or `/wave`) and `/roll` results with their respective RP names.

> **Note:** This feature requires your client to have the player's RP data cached (via MSP) to function correctly.
